# FIDELITY PLAN

Is inspired in [Spoleto Fidelidade](https://www.spoleto.com.br/fidelidade?utm_source=&utm_medium=SMSSPOL0073&utm_campaign=NOVOS&utm_content=CADASTRO_FIDELIDADE), 
a system which book customers orders counting it aiming 
giving back some benefits for those who are recurring in the restaurant.

I went to a good restaurant in the Mall. On there, the attendant asked me my
phone number in order to sign me up.
After months, I decided to sign up as well. However my number is already on the 
system so I had to claim my account with my phone number.

Both things caught my attention, the good food and the way I signed up on it, 
like customizing the Devise Authentication.
