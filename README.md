# FIDELITY PLAN

Is inspired in [Spoleto Fidelidade](https://www.spoleto.com.br/fidelidade?utm_source=&utm_medium=SMSSPOL0073&utm_campaign=NOVOS&utm_content=CADASTRO_FIDELIDADE), 
a system which book customers orders counting it aiming 
giving back some benefits for those who are recurring in the restaurant.

I went to a good restaurant in the Mall. On there, the attendant asked me my
phone number in order to sign me up.
After months, I decided to sign up as well. However my number is already on the 
system so I had to claim my account with my phone number.

Both things caught my attention, the good food and the way I signed up on it, 
like customizing the Devise Authentication.

## Whatsapp Chat bot

One way to manage restaurant customers is via whatsapp.

It is hard to accountability the restaurant customers orders in order to
apply some benefits in their favor.

So this is the reason it has been including on this version 
The ability to the chat bot using the restaurant data for interactions
with the customers.

For details of changing between releases take a look on the
release list.
